<p>This coin makes me think of my <b>son</b> Louis. 🦓</p>
<p>My son Louis owns 10% of the coin.</p>
<p>This coin was recorded as <b>coin No. 680</b> of the <b>Helmingham Hoard</b>, which was discovered at a find spot with Historic Environment Record (HER), formerly Sites and Monuments Record (SMR), "HLM 050", maintained by the Suffolk Archaeological Service. The data from record has not been made public by the Suffolk Archaeological Service at the request of the landowner, most probably to prevent looters from invading the site of the find. The coin was subsequently catalogued as <b>coin No. 259</b> by Ghey, the curator of hoards in the Department of Money and Medals at the British Museum in London. The full catalogue is available at the British Museum.</p>
<p>On 9 September of 2019, George Ridgway made a discovery of great historical and numismatic importance: the <b>Helmingham Hoard</b> of <b>British Iron Age and Roman coins</b>. An avid treasure hunter from a tender age – having received his first metal detector at just 12 years old as a gift from his grandmother – George Ridgway was drawn to <b>Helmingham Hall in Suffolk</b>, by its historical significance. Happily, Helmingham Hall’s residents shared his passion for the past, and he was granted private permission to detect the grounds. At the request of the landowner, the exact find spot is to remain undisclosed. However, it can be said that the hoard was found in a field close to a Roman road and that it has produced a general assemblage of Roman material. It can also be said that it was found close to a "small oddly shaped crop-circle"; this feature later transpired to be a natural pond, filled in during the course of agricultural work in the 19th century.</p>
<p>The day of discovery started with a scattering of Roman brooches, several of which have been dated to the first century, making them roughly contemporary with the hoard. Some 30 yards down the field came the first coin: a denarius of (Julius) Caesar, which poked its head up and was revealed. Over the next three hours, 206 coins (including the first coin) were found, spread across an area of approximately one and a half metres. George Ridgway, well aware of the significance of this find, was keen that it be properly recorded and assessed for archaeological significance. The local archaeologist was notified and George Ridgway’s father offered to camp at the site and keep watch; he stayed for two nights standing guard to protect the hoard. Shortly after, an extensive three-month-long archaeological dig was undertaken; this yielded a further 205 coins, with 314 more (including this coin) being found in the same archeological context (0001) during controlled metal detecting of the site within a 60-yard radius of the initial find. George Ridgway diligently returned to the site on 1st October 2020 and in 2021, finding a further 9 and 14 coins, respectively. All together, 748 coins were found: one Roman gold <b>aureus</b> of (Tiberius) Claudius (Caesar Augustus Germanicus; -10-54; r. 41-54), 724 Roman silver <b>denarii</b>, 19 British Iron Age gold <b>staters</b> and 4 <b>quarter staters</b> of the pre-Roman Britain king and chieftain of the Catuvellauni, Cunobelin (?-circa 40; r. circa 9-circa 40). This makes this hoard the largest mixed hoard of British Iron Age and Roman coins found to date in Britain.</p>
<p>Sherds of pottery were found near the corner of the field, in very close proximity to one of the denarii. Almost all the sherds are likely to belong to the same vessel, which probably contained the hoard; they are fragments of a grey ware bowl or jug. Among the grey ware fragments an undiagnostic, probably construction building material, fragment was also found.</p>
<p>The hoard was taken to the British Museum in London where the coins were conserved and catalogued, following the application of the 1996 Treasure Act, as Treasure case Nos. 2019T794, 2020T915 and 2021T655, for the finds in 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. The finds were recorded with the Portable Antiquities Scheme (PAS; see <a href="https://finds.org.uk" target="_blank" style="max-width: 100%">https://finds.org.uk</a>) with record IDs SF-8C645E, SF-521A7C and SF-AEA396, respectively. Sixty three coins were retained by various museums, with the rest being returned in early 2024 to the finder and landowners, who brought them to Noonans shortly after. Noonans offered 666 coins of the hoard (235 coins as individual lots and 431 coins as part of larger lots) at auction on 18 September 2024, in the hopes that its dispersal might inspire other treasure hunters and numismatists to continue in their efforts and to enable further study into this important part of Britain's history. When asked what he will do with the money raised from the auction, after splitting it with the landowners, George Ridgway said he will buy his dad a pint!</p>
<p>The earliest coin in the hoard is a denarius of the Roman Republic issued circa 206-195 BC and the latest are two denarii of Claudius issued in 46-47. The <b>terminus post quem</b> for the burial hoard is therefore 46-47, during the rule of the Roman emperor Claudius, just a few years after the beginning of the <b>Roman conquest of Britain</b>. The Claudian invasion of Britain began in 43, with the forces initially led by (Aulus) Plautius (?-before 65). By 47 Plautius had conquered and negotiated treaties with many of the southern tribes, only to be replaced in his role by (Publius) Ostorius (Scapula; ?-52). Early in 47 Ostorius introduced into law the compulsory disarmament of the British tribes, with exception granted for hunting equipment. Unsurprisingly, this was not well received by the subjugated locals; a guerrilla campaign ensued and the western tribes led by Caratacus (circa 10-circa 50; r. circa 40-50), the son of Cunobelin, and king and chieftain of the Catuvellauni, marched eastwards to face the Romans. Ostorius, in response, prepared his men for battle. Today this series of events is known as the <b>Iceni Revolt of 47</b>. Almost everyone, historian or not, has heard of the queen of the Iceni, <b>Boudica</b> (?-60/61; r. circa 60/61), who led the <b>Iceni Rebellion of 60/61</b>. In contrast, the Iceni Revolt of 47 remains far more obscure, both within academic circles and public consciousness; the discovery of the Helmingham Hoard offers a tangible insight into this fascinating period of our Britain’s history.</p>
<p>Helmingham Hall lies just short of twenty seven miles north of <b>Camulodunum</b> (now Colchester in Essex), an important early Roman settlement. It is here that veterans of the <b>Legio XX Valeria Victrix</b> retired to prior to 49. According to (Publius Cornelius) Tacitus (circa 56-circa 120), Ostorius brought down the Iceni Revolt with "allied troops, without the strength of the legions"; it seems quite plausible that legionary veterans would be included in this number. Sixty five miles to the north of Helmingham Hall is Stonea Camp, a hillfort which has been identified as the place where the Romans, finally and ultimately, put down the Iceni Revolt.</p>
<p>Helmingham Hall, then, fell right in the middle of these dramatic events. It is tempting to assume that the hoard’s original owner was an active participant in this conflict. One can speculate from the hoard’s considerable value, with the 724 Denarii equating to just over three years salary for an ordinary legionary, that its owner might have been a high-ranking legionary (e.g., an "optio"). One can go further still, sketching in loosest terms his career in Britain: he came over to Britain in 43 with the Legio XX Valeria Victrix, then travelled up north with Plautius’ forces, settled in Camulodunum for a short while, before heeding Ostorius call to arms to put down the Iceni Revolt; he travelled north to the region of Helmingham Hall where the hoard was buried by the pond, before going onwards up to Stonea Camp where he fell in battle. However, none of this need be true. It was quite common for people who had access neither to banks nor vaults to conceal their wealth in the ground, even in times of peace. Whatever the case, a hoard of this size would not easily be forgotten and its retrieval must have been prevented by some great personal misfortune. The truth is that no one will never know the name or position of the Helmingham Hoard’s original owner; what can be said is that the original owner was a participant in one of the most dramatic and impactful chapters in Britain's history.</p></p></td>

RCC1 noted 57 obverse dies and 63 reverse dies. The question of the number of coins that could be struck from a single ancient die before it was discarded is contentious. Modern experiments suggest that an obverse die could strike about 15,000 acceptable coins, a reverse die only about half as many. However, often more than two reverse dies were used with an obverse die, since dies were often replaced before they wore out. Using a conservative figure of 10,000 coins per die, the production of this denarius type would be 570,000 denarii for 57 obverse dies.</td>

  <td colspan="10" class="cell_full text"><p>The regular coinage of the Republican <b>moneyers</b> is typically arranged under the family name of the moneyer responsible for the issue of the coins, when these were identifiable, and then numbered them under each family. This arrangement is widely adopted for reference because it is so much easier than a chronological arrangement. Republican moneyers almost always acted as a board of three members, called the <b>"tresviri monetales"</b> or "tresviri aere argento auro flando feriundo", literally "three men for casting (and) striking bronze, silver (and) gold (coins)", with an annual tenure. Individually, they are often referred to as "triumvir monetalis", which is the singular form of "tresviri monetales". The "tresviri monetales" were included in the <b>"Vigintisexvirate"</b>, a college of twenty-six minor magistrates. An office in the "Vigintisexvirate" was for most of them the first step on the <b>cursus honorum</b>. The long title "tresviri aere argento auro flando feriundo" was abbreviated "III. VIR. AAAFF." or even "III. VIR. A.P.F." for "tresviri ad pecuniam feriundam" on the coinage.</p>
<p>The "tresviri monetales" were not simple "monetarii" (mint workers), they were officials who controlled the process, including the design on the coins themselves. The moneyers' control of the legend on the coinage lent itself to the production of coins often containing propagandist political messaging. This served as self-advertising to further the potential political careers of the moneyers themselves, their families or that of those controlling them.</p></td>

  <td colspan="7" class="cell_left text" style="vertical-align: top;"><p><b>(To the right)</b> Equestrian statue of <b>Vercingetorix</b>, designed by Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi (1834-1904) in 1899, erected in <b>Place de Jaude in Clermont-Ferrand</b> since 1903</p>
<p>This coin bears the name of the "triumvir monetalis" Lucius Hostilius Saserna (?-?). Hoards showed that he belonged as a "triumvir monetalis" in the same year as the "tresviri monetales" Caius (Vibius) Pansa (Caetronianus; ?-43 BC) and Decimus (Junius) Brutus (Albinus; 81-43 BC). Decimus Brutus certainly belongs in 48 BC since he was besieging Massalia in 49 BC and was appointed to Gallia Transalpina late in 48 BC; Caius Pansa was in Rome in 48 BC. Hence, this coin was most likely struck in 48 BC. <b>Julius Caesar</b> (100-44 BC) designated Caius Pansa as consul for 43 BC, who  took office, and Decimus Brutus for 42 BC, but he died before taking office. Lucius Saserna is not known to have held further office.</p>
<p>The <b>cognomen</b> Saserna was common in the <b>"gens"</b> Hostilia. It is then probable that he is the brother of two other people with this cognomen, a Saserna (?-?) whose first name is not known, and Publius Saserna (?-?). The three Saserna (brothers?) were lieutenants of Caesar during the battle of Africa in 46 BC. Lucius Saserna had always remained very attached to Caesar. (Marcus Tullius) Cicero (106-43 BC) indicated that, after the death of Caesar, Lucius Saserna became friend with Marcus Antonius (83-30 BC), known in English as Mark Antony, and Gaius Octavius (-63-14), also known as Octavian and future Augustus.</p>
<p>Lucius Saserna is known to have struck under his name three types (e.g., RRC1#448). The types refer without exception to Caesar's victories during his command in Gaul. The head on the obverse of this coin is frequently identified as that of the celebrated Gallic king and chieftain of the <b>Arverni</b>, <b>Vercingetorix</b>, but this identification must be regarded as highly conjectural. It can also be identified as the head of <b>Pavor</b> (Roman god and personification of fear), a companion of Mars (Roman god and personification of war) along with Pallor (Roman goddess and personification of paleness). Pavor would then appear with the traits of a bearded man with bristling hair; perhaps Pavor was given the traits of Vercingetorix; the Gallic shield placed behind the head allows this conjecture. Lucius Saserna would have thus reminded his contemporaries, at the same time as the recent victorious campaign of Caesar in Gaul, of a family tradition: his ancestor, the legendary third king of Rome Tullus Hostilius (r. circa 673–642 BC) had for the first time erected temples dedicated to Pavor and Pallor. It is recounted that these temples were erected on account of the fear that seized the Roman army in a battle against the Fidenates and Veians. Their allies, the Albans, suddenly turned against them in this battle, and the Roman army fled in fear. Tullus Hostilius then vowed, if he was victorious, to raise a temple dedicated to Pavor and Pallor.</p></td>
